                From a young age I was fortunate to be able to receive high
                quality education that went beyond gaining knowledge, also
                focusing on instilling values and forming well rounded
                people.

                After finishing high-school I decided to pursue my higher
                education in England knowing that this decision would mean
                being able to get exceptional education, learn valuable life
                skills and gain more independence. During 2012-2013, I went
                to the
                <a

                >
                    University of Bristol
                </a>
                to do an IFP English with Physics and Mathematics course.
                Following this first experience I moved on to the
                <a className="default-link mx-1" href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/">
                    University of Essex
                </a>
                on 2013 to start a Bsc. Computer Science degree after which
                I completed an MSc. Advanced Web Engineering at the same
                institution culminating my studies in July 2018.

                The undergraduate and postgraduate degrees I obtained at the
                University of Essex provided me with a good understanding of
                fundamental concepts in the IT field and I believe have
                equipped me with valuable software design and development
                skills across a wide range of subjects. I learned these by
                taking various modules such as: Professional development,
                Object-Oriented programming, Web development, Introduction
                to Databases, Network Fundamentals, Software engineering,
                Application programming, Data structures and algorithms,
                Human computer interfaces and visualisation, Web application
                programming and Advanced programming among others. On my
                final year of undergraduate I worked on a program for the
                rendering of procedurally generated 3D cities using PyOpenGL
                and for my postgraduate dissertation project I developed a
                web-based IoT fuzzy ventilation controller dependent on room
                temperature and humidity.

                Along my studies, I found a prime interest in web
                technologies and the possibilities that internet
                applications offer. I am fascinated by the profound impact
                on society and scale of some of the world leading companies
                in the field e.g. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Netflix, etc.
                and would like to be part of the revolution, and perhaps
                even one day begin my own online business. I have learned
                the importance of frontend interface design and enjoy the
                process of optimizing application backends for a scalable
                performance that ensures a pleasant user experience.
